# Chapter 8 Define the Problem

Problems usually arise when you have an undesired result -R1, but you want a desired outcome - R2. The solution is the steps from R1 to R2.

Technically, the method to define the problem is called continuous analysis and follows the following questions:
1. Is there/is it possible to have a problem (or opportunity)?
2. Where is the problem?
3. why does it exist (the root cause of the problem)?
4. What can we do?
5. How do we do it?
Where Q1 and Q2 define the problem, and Q3-5 is the best approach to finding the optimal solution.

Normally, the problem indicating the gap between the undesired result and the desired outcome is caused by a certain situation or under a set of conditions.
The problem could be displayed clearly with key elements including:
- *Starting Point/Open Scene*
- *Disturbing Event*
- *Current Situation - R1, Undesired Result*
- *End Goal - R2, Desired Result*

## **Starting Point**

## **Disturbing Event**

## **Current Situation, R1**

## **End Goal, R2**
